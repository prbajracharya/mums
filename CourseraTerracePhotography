I usually hang around in my terrace in the evening and listen to music. 
One such day I remembered that I need to submit my coursera photography assignment. 
I grabbed my camera and took a snap of beautiful nature. 
Nature is what attracts me and the first shot was what I took out of my first attraction. 
I took few shots, recalled what I learned in the course and I came up with the “BEST” shot that 
I eventually decided is well composed, without blurry and good color composition. 
The vivid image of moon, color of dawn and the silhouette of my neighbor’s house is what I got from 10 minutes of photography in my terrace.
